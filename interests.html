        <h1>Interests</h1>
        <p>This section describes some interests that I have outside of work.</p>
        <h2>Linux</h2>
        <img src="Linux2.png" class="linux">
        <p>Linux is a computer operating system that is an alternative to Microsoft Windows.  Over the past few
           years, I've worked on learning more about Linux by installing it and using it on my personal
           laptop.  I've tried running a few Linux distributions on a virtual machine, I've tried installing
           it beside Windows so that my laptop is a dual-boot system (2 or more operating systems) and I've
           tried working with it as the sole operating system on my laptop.  I've mainly worked with the
           Linux Mint and Ubuntu Linux distributions, but there are many Linux distributions available.  A lot
           of these different Linux distributions can be found at the <a target="_blank" href = "https://distrowatch.com/">DistroWatch</a> website.</p>
        <h2>Cycling</h2>
        <img src="Bike.jpg" class="bike">
        <p>I enjoy riding my street bike around the various neighborhoods to look around near where we are.  I recently rode over
           to the Corso Italia neighborhood in Toronto, which is a great area for cafes and patio dining.  It's a bit far to walk to but
           also a bit of a hassle to get there by transit, so biking felt like an ideal way to see the neighborhood.  My bike also
           comes in handy if I need to run an errand at a store nearby but it's not really within walking distance.</p>
        <h2>Reading</h2>
        <img src="Book2.jpg" class="book">
        <p>I like to read both fiction and non-fiction, so I'll usually alternate between the two.  This
           is especially the case if the non-fiction book was very heavy and serious and I'll then read
           fiction as an escape.  A book I read recently by Canadian author Thomas King, called <em>Double Eagle</em>, was a very
           entertaining murder mystery set in the American Northwest.</p>
        <h2>Music</h2>
        <img src="Record3.jpg" class="record">
        <p>I like to listen to music from a variety of different genres; mainly rock, metal, electronic and sometimes
           blues.  We recently bought a record player and we are starting to build up a vinyl record collection.  Lately,
           I've been on a synthwave/electronic music kick, listening to bands like <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Com_Truise">Com Truise</a> 
           and <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M83_(band)">M83</a>.</p>
        <h2>Video Games</h2>
        <img src="Controller2.jpg" class="games">
        <p>I enjoy playing video games on my Xbox as well.  I'm mainly interested in survival, space exploration and 3rd-person 
            action RPG (role-playing) games.  A couple of games that I've really enjoyed playing recently are
            <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nomanssky.com/">No Man's Sky</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/elden-ring">Elden Ring</a>.</p>
