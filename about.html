        <p>Hi, I'm John Bracken.  I'm currently living in Toronto, Canada with my wife and daughter.  I grew up
           in various places including Timmins, Ottawa and London in Ontario and Victoria in British Columbia. I
           went to McMaster University in Hamilton and got an engineering physics degree and then went to graduate
           school for medical physics at the University of Toronto.  I still keep in touch and visit with some friends
           from university every few weeks or so who are still living relatively close by.  I worked in medical imaging
           research for 15 years in Toronto and Denver, Colorado before making the switch to data engineering
           a few years ago, but I'm still working with medical data.  I enjoy going out to explore the city, trying new
           restaurants and taking day trips to towns in Southern Ontario with my family.  I also enjoy getting
           down to the waterfront when I get the chance.</p>
